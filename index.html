    <h4>Welcome to Deepali's first created quiz Game!</h4>
    <p>Before I start this game quickly wanted you to know how I created this app.
        1.I have used replit platform to create this CLI app.
        2.I have chose nodejs to code this program.
        3.To take the user inputs I have used readlineSync.
        4.Used different objects for the bunch of questions.
        5.To get the questions one by one ,I kept them in an array & accessed accordingly.
        6.I have used for loop,if else and functions to make the program less complex & easy to understand.

        You can also create your own app by exploring in above given things.
